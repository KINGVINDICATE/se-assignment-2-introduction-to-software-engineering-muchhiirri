Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles and practices to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It involves the use of structured methods, tools, and techniques to produce high-quality, reliable, and efficient software that meets the needs of users and organizations.
The primary difference between software engineering and traditional programming lies in the scope, approach, and overall focus of the development process.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that outlines the stages involved in the development and maintenance of software systems. 
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. It is a crucial phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) 
Modularity is a fundamental software design principle that involves breaking down a software system into smaller, independent, and reusable components or modules.
